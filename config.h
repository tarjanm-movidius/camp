/* You can change the 7:th button on the top row to whatever command you
   want, but please make sure that CUSTOM_BUTTON is 4 chars long (may
   include spaces, i.e. " pl ", "mixr"

   NICE_NAMES will parse mp3 filenames without ID3 tag this way:
   group.name-song.name.mp3  becomes
   group name - song name    in the player window.
