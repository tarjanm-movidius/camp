# Example config for CAMP 1.7:
#
# player     = mp3 player with complete path
# playmode   = random, repeat or normal
# switches   = switches to pass to player. (If -m is entered, then do mpg123 -m)
# params     = alias for switches.
# hidedot    = hide files/dirs beginning with a dot?
# dontreopen = don't close stdout & stderr, and reopen them to /dev/null.
# showlength = can be playlist, main or both. ( Show song total time )
# timemode   = count time from start ( normal ), or countdown ( reverse )
# startincwd  = open playlist browser in current dir ( instead of root )
# ttymode     = 8bit or 7bit (unused in v1.7)
# readid3     = true for loading id3 tags on load, false loads on open
# volumestep  = incr/decr volume this many steps each time key is pressed (0-100)
# volumedev   = device to change volume on, can be pcm, synth, main, or a
#               numeric value, check SOUND_MIXER_??? values in sys/soundcard.h
# userc       = use remote control? can be overriden by --norc
# rctime      = time in microseconds between remote-poll, keep at 900000 if no rc
# playerprio  = Acts like a renice, highest prio is -20, lowest 20, only
#               root can set higher priority than 0
# compresspl  = compress playlist? (500kb playlist will be ~40k)
#               if you set this to 0, you can still read compressed playlists,
#               if camp was compiled with zlib support.
# scrollname  = Scroll title ala WinAmp at main screen if it's too long?
# lockvt      = Lock computer to camp console only when going into "lock" mode?
# forkonerror = If we got a segfault, try to fork into background?
# tip         = Show tips on startup? (yes/no)
# defplaylist = Load/save default playlist on startup/exit (like winamp)
#               (if no other playlists or files is called on the commandline)
# mpg123mode  = Use mpg123's jukebox mode? (enables seeking in mp3 files, rew/ff).
#               Has some advantages, and some things are nice less, try it out!
#		*works only with mpg123*
# dropinfo   =  If yes, camp will dump current songinfo to 'dropfile'
# dropfile   =  This is the path/filename of the above dropfile.
#
# yes, true or 1 will activate a setting, anything else will inactivate it.
#
# If you don't use mpg123, xaudio or amp, it might be a good idea to enter
# switches = (whatever switch to make the player stop output text)

# If skin is "random" there has to be a file called ~/.camp/skins/random
# The first line should be a number saying how many skins that are listed,
# and the rest of the lines will be the names of the skins.
# Otherwise, just type the dir name of the skin located in
# ~/.camp/skins/random, f.e. "skin = leetamp"
