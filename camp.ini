# Example config for CAMP 1.4: 
#
# player     = mp3 player with complete path
# playmode   = random, repeat or normal
# switches   = switches to pass to player. (If -m is entered, then do mpg123 -m)
# params     = alias for switches.
# hidedot    = hide files/dirs beginning with a dot?
# dontreopen = don't close stdout & stderr, and reopen them to /dev/null.
# showlength = can be playlist, main or both. ( Show song total time )
# timemode   = count time from start ( normal ), or countdown ( reverse ) 
# startincwd = open playlist browser in current dir ( instead of root )
# ttymode    = 8bit or 7bit
# readid3    = true for loading id3 tags on load, false loads on open
# volumestep = incr/decr volume this many steps each time key is pressed (0-100)
# volumedev  = device to change volume on, can be pcm, synth, main, or a
#              numeric value, check SOUND_MIXER_??? values in sys/soundcard.h
# userc      = use remote control? can be overriden by --norc
# rctime     = time in microseconds between reads, keep at 900000 if no rc
# playerprio = Acts like a renice, highest prio is -20, lowest 20, only
#              root can set higher priority than 0
# compresspl = compress playlist? (500kb playlist will be ~40k)
#              if you set this to 0, you can still read compressed playlists,
#              if camp was compile with zlib support.
# scrollname = Scroll title ala WinAmp at main screen if it's too long?
#
# yes, true or 1 will activate a setting, anything else will inactivate it.
#
# If you don't use mpg123, xaudio or amp, it might be a good idea to enter
# switches = (whatever switch to make the player stop output text)

# If skin is "random" there has to be a file called ~/.camp/skins/random
# The first line should be a number saying how many skins that are listed,
# and the rest of the lines will be the names of the skins.
