* Fixed a stupid bug wich made camp segfault if your default mp3 player wasn't

  edited some text field (like in the id3 editor), while camp switched songs.

* Fixed another bug that made the playlist segfault randomly..
* Fixed the mute-button crap ( Does any skin actually use it yet ?! )
+ Added some information about who's stealing your session using "camp -s"
  (Uh, we run camp at work now, so everyone's using telnet to steal it)

- I finished doing my military services and got out of the army 4ever i hope.
  This mainly means that I finally can spend some time on this project again,
  trying to trace all thoose stupid segfaults down. Please help me!

2000-06-25: v1.5-beta1.2889

* IR remote controls supported, via LIRCD.

* Moving with cursors now possible in id3-tag editor and save playlist field.

* Camp will run under FreeBSD/SunOS again, without mouse/remote support
* Glibc 2.1's ( 2.0 too? ) fgets() doesn't replace newline with NULL as libc5
  does, therefore, text-playlist couldn't be loaded. Fixed.

+ Added support for scrolling long names at mainscreen.
! If you play like 40000+ songs in the same session, camp will segfault.

1999-04-13: v1.3-beta3/final.2410

  when stealing, and being elsewhere than the mainscreen.

1998-10-07: v1.2.1373

* Fixed the "redhat" config-read error. (glibc2 did probably not act as libc5)
* Fixed that stupid "desc" bug AGAIN :)
* As usual, fixed some other small bugs.
* Splitted playlist.c into filelist.c/playlist.c so it's a bit easier to read :)
* Runs better on slow terminals ( telnet ), it won't take a esc-seq for quit.
+ Added mouse support ( Trough GPM )

  song if you aren't at the mainscreen.

  Quick-fix: Remove it and use the one camp will create.

1998-05-09: v1.1.854

  or a directory wich you didn't have permissions to enter.
