+ Add
- Remove
! Known bug


1998-09-xx: v1.2.13xx

* Fixed a small (but important) bug, that made camp start two songs sometimes.. 
* Fixed the "redhat" config-read error. (glibc2 did probably not act as libc5)
* Fixed that stupid "desc" bug AGAIN :)
* As usual, fixed some other small bugs.
* Splitted playlist.c into filelist.c/playlist.c so it's a bit easier to read :)
* Runs better on slow terminals ( telnet ), it won't take a esc-seq for quit.
+ Added mouse support ( Trough GPM )
+ Added ^Z/fork ( and -b ) support, use camp -s ( --steal ) to load it up again.
+ Added support to kill a running camp by running camp --kill
+ Added --force commandline option, to start multiple sessions (no pid file)
+ Added config option for 7bit-tty support.
+ Added config option to start browser in current dir instead of root dir (/).
! This is not really a bug, but when "stealing" a camp, it won't load up a new
  song if you aren't at the mainscreen.

1998-06-03: v1.1.956

* Fixed a bug, -p without a slash in the name caused camp to segfault.
* Fixed a bug, "desc" caused a segfault if you pressed it without files loaded.
* Fixed a bug wich appeared when clearing playlists.
* Fixed a bug in the sorting routine.
* Fixed some other small bugs
* Some optimization done
+ Added songtime in main window/playlist editor ( includes new playlist format )
! Some f*cking redhat systems gets crazy reading the *default* ~/.camp,
  and I don't know why. Suggestions? Mail me! 
  Quick-fix: Remove it and use the one camp will create.

1998-05-09: v1.1.854

* Fixed a bug, wich made mpg123 and others fail to play songs when they wanted.
  to write to stdout or stderr, so now thoose are reopened as /dev/null.
* Fixed a bug wich made camp coredump if you tried to enter a broken symlink,
  or a directory wich you didn't have permissions to enter.
* Fixed some small design flaws with the "lock" function.
* Fixed the filelist editor, so if you press enter on the "add" button, while
  having a dir marked it will enter the dir, just like pressing space.
* Fixed a bug in the filelister wich hided some regular files, also speeded
  up the filelister ( load new/change dir ) by 50%. 
* Fixed some other small bugs.
+ Added config option to show/not show files/dirs beginning with '.'.
+ Added config option to pass params directly to the player.
+ Added config option to disable reopening of stdout and stderr.
+ Added alphabetical sorting of the dirs/file, when tagging files.
+ Added a "jump" button, for thoose who are very familiar with their playlists.
+ Added a "sort" button in the playlist editor, to sort the playlist in alphabetic order.
- Removed the "help" button, since it didn't have any function anyway.
