This is growing old, and I hate writing doc's... 
I have just re-written some nessecary stuff, the rest still suck.

1.1 - Disclaimer:

I am NOT responsible for any trouble that CAMP can cause to your
computer or any of it's components. You have to use this software totally
at your own risk! ( I doubt it's risky to use it anyway :) )


1.2 - Notice:

If you find any bugs, try to remeber HOW you made the 
bug appear, or even better, if you can make up some kind of fix, mail the
fix/bug to me at inm@sector7.nu. This documentation has a really
low quality, and that's just because i hate to write doc's, and english 
isn't my native language ;)
Feel very free to mail me with any comments/ideas you have.


1.3.1 - Things to do in future versions:

* Cleanup the code, remove some global variables.
* Fix all the small bugs i don't know of yet.
* Write a nicer documentation (did you really belive that?)
( No really important stuff )


1.3.2 - Requests:

* Shuffle, some people hate my random =)
* Cd/radio support on the interface.
* Daemon mode for controlling camp with one pc, and actually doing the
  shit on another pc. (* Actually, ESD solves this *)

Pleas mail me (inm@sector7.nu) with heaps of suggestions/ideas! I'm
running out of 'em ;(


2.1 - Install:

To compile and install the camp-source, type the following commands:

./configure
make
make install
cp skins.tar ~/.camp
cd ~/.camp
tar xvf skins.tar

Make sure to edit "/.camp/camprc" in your homedirectory to point the player
variable to mpg123 or any other command-line mp3 player. 
CAMP is known to compile and run under any linux distribution. older
versions did also compile under SunOS, but I haven't cared to test newer
version. It does also compile under *BSD, but i think the keys are
fucked-up, and I will use ncurses for reading keys, as soon as I feel like
rewriting that.


2.2 - Syntax:

-h, --help
Will show some help on the switches you can use with camp.

-p, --playlist
Camp can be started without any parameters, but you could also start it
with "camp -p /path/to/playlist/allfiles.lst", OR simply start it with the
command "camp /songs/mp3/*mp3". Notice that if you load your files
normal once, then save them as a "ID3" playlist, will make camp load
them at least ten times faster, since it doesn't have to scan them for
samplerates/ID3 tags.

-s, --steal
"Steal" control of a running camp session. Useful when you have used the
"fork" button, or pressed ^Z.

-k, --kill
Steal & kill a running camp session.

-b, --background
Never load the interface, put camp in the background directly.

-d, --dumpid3
Dumps all id3-tags, or in case there is no id3 tag, dump the filename to
stdout.

-f, --force
Load even if another camp is running, do not write pid-file. (non-stealabe)

--norc
Do not try to use the remote-control


2.3 - Converting playlists:

Before installing your brand new CAMP version, you can save your playlist
WITHOUT id3 tags, because every camp (and x11amp) is able to read raw
playlists. When you have installed the new CAMP, load the playlist, and
save it with id3 tags again.


2.4 - Config "camprc" format:

player     = mp3 player with complete path.
switches   = switches to pass to player.
playmode   = random, repeat or normal.
hidedot    = hide files/dirs beginning with a dot?
dontreopen = don't close stdout & stderr and reopen them to /dev/null.
showlength = can be playlist, main or both. ( Show song total time )
timemode   = Count time from start ( normal ), or countdown ( reverse )
startincwd = Open playlist browser in current dir ( instead of root dir )
skin       = Name of skin, skins are found in ~/.camp/skins/<name>
playerprio = Acts like a renice, highest prio is -20, lowest 20, only root can
             set higher priority than 0
volumestep = incr/decr volume this many steps each time key is pressed (0-100)
volumedev  = device to change volume on, can be pcm, synth, main, or a
             numeric value, check SOUND_MIXER_??? values in sys/soundcard.h
userc      = use remote control? can be overriden by --norc
rctime     = time in microseconds between reads, keep at 900000 if no rc
compresspl = compress playlist? (500kb playlist will be ~40k)
             if you set this to 0, you can still read compressed playlists,
             if camp was compile with zlib support.
scrollname = Scroll title ala WinAmp at main screen if it's too long?

yes, true or 1 will activate a setting, anything else will inactivate it.

port,play,stop,skipb,skipf,vol+ & vol- are remote-control values.

port = the decimal address of the printer-port the remote-control is
       attached to.
play,stop,skipb,skipf,vol+ & vol- are the values of the port when pressing
the button. Values can be obtained using the "testrc" program that is
built by typing "make rctools" 

If you don't use mpg123, xaudio or amp, it might be a good idea to enter
switches = (whatever switch to make the player stop output text to stdout/err)

My default config is as follows:

skin       = rawlock
player     = /usr/local/bin/mpg123
switches   = 
playerprio = 0
playmode   = random
hidedot    = yes
dontreopen = false
showlength = playlist
timemode   = reverse
startincwd = yes
readid3    = true
volumestep = 5
volumedev  = pcm
userc      = true
rctime     = 25000
scrollname = yes
compresspl = yes

# Remote-Control Configuration
port  = 888
play  = 79
stop  = 255
skipb = 111
skipf = 95
vol+  = 119
vol-  = 63


2.5 - Interface buttons, functions:

*** If using any other skins than camp-8bit, this isn't really correct ***


Row 1, at the mainscreen:

dark "®®" button: 
 Skips back one song

light "¯¯" button:
 If playmode is normal or repeat (loop), it will restart the current song,
 and if playmode is random, it will random another song.

dark "¯¯" button:
 Skips forward one song

light "þþ" button:
 Stops the music, if it's playing.

light "®¯" button:
 Changes the playmode, normal, repeat or random.
 Normal means play untill all songs have been played, then exit.
 Repeat (loop) plays like normal, but jumps from last song to first (neverending)
 Random chooses the song totally random (neverending)

light "pl" button:
 Loads up the playlist editor.

light, custom button, defaults to "mixr"
 If default settings, will try to execute /usr/bin/alsamixer, check config.h
 in the source to change.


Row 2, at the mainscreen:

light "||" button:
 Will pause the song, and continue it if you press pause or play.

light "jump" button:
 Will ask you for a songnumber to jump to.

light "lock" button:
 Locks the console so noone can exit CAMP, useful if you want to play
 as root, while there's some hackers around ;)

light "desc" button:
 Will create/edit the so-called ID3 tag, wich contains informaton about
 the file, very useful if the song uses some strange chars that you don't
 want to use in the filename.

light "fork" button:
 Puts camp in the background, leaving the tty free for other use. Run
 camp --steal to load up the interface again.
