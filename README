1.1 - Disclaimer:

I am NOT responsible for any trouble that CAMP can cause to your
computer or any of it's components. You have to use this software totally
at your own risk! ( I doubt it's risky to use it anyway :) )


1.2 - Notice:

If you find any bugs, try to remeber HOW you made the 
bug appear, or even better, if you can make up some kind of fix, mail the
fix/bug to me at inm@m1crosoft.com. This documentation has a really
low quality, and that's just because i hate to write doc's, and that
english isn't my native language ;)
Feel very free to mail me with any comments/ideas you have.


1.3.1 - Things to do in future versions:

* Cleanup the code, remove some global variables.
* Fix all the small bugs i don't know of yet.
* Write a nicer documentation
( No really important stuff )


1.3.2 - Requests:

None that aren't already fixed, pleas mail me (inm@m1crosoft.com) with
heaps of suggestions! I'm running out of ideas ;(


2.1 - Install:

To compile and install the camp-source, type the following commands:

./configure
./make
./make install

If you don't know what to answer when running configure, it's probably
safe for everyone to answer use Linux defaults or Termios.

Make sure to edit ".camp" in your homedirectory to point the player
variable to mpg123 or any other command-line mp3 player. 
CAMP is known to compile and run under Linux, and SunOS.


2.2 - Syntax:

-h, --help
Will show some help on the switches you can use with camp.

-p, --playlist
Camp can be started without any parameters, but you could also start it
with "camp -p /path/to/playlist/allfiles.lst", OR simply start it with the
command "camp /songs/mp3/*mp3". Notice that if you load your files
normal once, then save them as a "ID3" playlist, will make camp load
them at least ten times faster, since it doesn't have to scan them for
samplingrates/ID3 tags.

-s, --steal
"Steal" control of a running camp session. Useful when you have used the
"fork" button, or pressed ^Z.

-k, --kill
Steal & kill a running camp session.

-b, --background
Never load the interface, put camp in the background directly.


2.3 - Converting playlists:

Before installing your brand new CAMP version, you can save your playlist
WITHOUT id3 tags, because every camp (and x11amp) is able to read raw
playlists. When you have installed the new CAMP, load the playlist, and
save it with id3 tags again.


2.4 - Config ".camp" format:

player     = mp3 player with complete path.
switches   = switches to pass to player.
playmode   = random, repeat or normal.
hidedot    = hide files/dirs beginning with a dot?
dontreopen = don't close stdout & stderr, and reopen them to /dev/null.
showlength = can be playlist, main or both. ( Show song total time )
timemode   = Count time from start ( normal ), or countdown ( reverse )
startincwd = Open playlist browser in current dir ( instead of root dir )
ttymode    = 8bit or 7bit ( 7bit will not print chars > ascii 127 )

yes, true or 1 will activate a setting, anything else will inactivate it.

If you don't use mpg123, xaudio or amp, it might be a good idea to enter
switches = (whatever switch to make the player stop output text to stdout/err)

My default config is as follows:

player     = /usr/local/bin/xaudio
playmode   = random
hidedot    = yes
dontreopen = false
showlength = playlist
timemode   = reverse
startincwd = yes
ttymode    = 8bit
switches   =


2.5 - Interface buttons, functions:

Row 1, at the mainscreen:

dark "®®" button: 
 Skips back one song

light "¯¯" button:
 If playmode is normal or repeat (loop), it will restart the current song,
 and if playmode is random, it will random another song.

dark "¯¯" button:
 Skips forward one song

light "þþ" button:
 Stops the music, if it's playing.

light "®¯" button:
 Changes the playmode, normal, repeat or random.
 Normal means play untill all songs have been played, then exit.
 Repeat (loop) plays like normal, but jumps from last song to first (neverending)
 Random chooses the song totally random (neverending)

light "pl" button:
 Loads up the playlist editor.

light, custom button, defaults to "mixr"
 If default settings, will try to execute /usr/bin/aumix, check config.h
 in the source to change.


Row 2, at the mainscreen:

light "||" button:
 Will pause the song, and continue it if you press pause or play.

light "jump" button:
 Will ask you for a songnumber to jump to.

light "lock" button:
 Locks the console so noone can exit CAMP, useful if you want to play
 as root, while there's some hackers around ;)

light "desc" button:
 Will create/edit the so-called ID3 tag, wich contains informaton about
 the file, very useful if the song uses some strange chars that you don't
 want to use in the filename.

light "fork" button:
 Puts camp in the background, leaving the tty free for other use. Run
 camp --steal to load up the interface again.
