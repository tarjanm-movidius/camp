Report bugs and ideas to inm@sector7.nu, nothing is too stupid to report!
You can tag files in the playlist either using "tag all" or tagging single files using the spacebar.
You can add files recursively, using the "DiRe!" button in the filelist windows.
You can raise/lower the volume with the +/- buttons if you've entered the correct information into ~/.camp/camprc.
You can disable/enable the initial ID3 scan for faster loading of mp3-files.
You can lock the console to camp's virtual terminal with password support, by running camp with the "-l" switch.
You can make camp run in the background by starting it with the "-b" switch.
You can read ~/.camp/tip.txt manually and then disable this annoying delay ;)
You can enable mpg123 jukebox mode in the config, and use rew/ff with skins that supports this feature, or by press and hold the skip buttons. (Still HIGHLY experimental)
