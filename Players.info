MPEG3 Player speed comparision by inm (1998-05-26)


Background:
 I were amazed over the VERY small cpu-load x11amp made, even when running
 "top -q" it didn't really go more than 20% at any time. I decided to test
 this for real.


Method:
 I played the same mp3 file, with 44KHz, 128Kbit and stereo sound in all tests.
 The actual test was done by running my rc5 client in "idle-mode", wich means
 that it will run at full cpu load, but give up all the power that other
 programs might want to use. I ran "rc5des -benchmark2" several times for
 each player, and it did not differ very much from time to time. 
 I did not have any other load than the mp3 player, rc5, and for the X tests,
 I had to run X (with KDE). If you don't know what rc5 is, go to
 http://www.distributed.net. For all players except the real X players, 
 i used camp as interface (wich i concider uses non-noticeable cpu power).


Equipment:
 Intel pentium 75 overclocked to 120MHz
 24Mb ram
 Linux (Slackware) 2.0.33 + Memcopy patch
 Sound blaster's vibra 16 (SB16 budget version)


Versions:
 xaudio		version 1.0a [decoder library 1.11]
 mpg123		Version 0.59o (1998/Feb/08)
 amp		0.7.6
 x11amp		0.7-libc5


Results:
 *NOTICE* The cpu percentage is the amount of cpu that was free for the rc5 
 client to use (ie. remaining cpu power), assuming that "zero load" was when
 no player or rc5 was running.
 

Player		Console:	in X:	Comments:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
xaudio		76%		74,5%	Neat player and X interface.
mpg123		73%		*71,5%	I used this, before this test ;)
amp		68,5%		*66%	-
x11amp		-		65,5%	Without scroller and spectrum
x11amp		-		24%	With scroller and spectrum

* Doesn't have a X interface, runned in a xterm (to compare load, X - not X)
